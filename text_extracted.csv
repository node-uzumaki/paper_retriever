description,"Since the early 2000's, much attention has been paid to human thermal assessment in urban outdoor environments in different climatic zones. Some previous studies have argued that an absence of an agreed protocol for outdoor human bio-meteorological research causes complexity in comparing the studies' results for several reasons: An abundance of human thermal indices, a variety of interpretations of bio-meteorological terms, an array of procedures for data collection and a lack of agreed methods in determining thermal comfort ranges and index modifications. This study aims to review strategies and methods for human bio-meteorological research and to examine their suitability for thermal perception assessment. From 2001 to 2021, 254 case studies assessed human thermal perception by investigating in-situ thermal conditions versus subjective thermal perception, relying on protocols such as ASHRAE Standard 55 and EN ISO 10551 that were originally developed for indoor environments. Fifty-four cases determined different ranges for thermal comfort. Although 43 studies tried to modify indices to various climatic zones, only 13 studies modified the nine PET physiological stress categories and 4 studies modified the ten UTCI stress categories). Thus, comparisons between the studies' results become complicated. Our review points to three main reasons for the complexity: first, the 7-point TSV scales, does not always fit the scales of the applied thermal index; second, measurement procedures do not always represent the local climate conditions; third, certain methods for modifying thermal index scale thresholds are not capable of modifying the entire index scale. On the basis of our findings, we suggest a framework for bio-meteorological research, with attention to measurement procedure, appropriate questionnaire design, careful data control and suitable methods to enable modification of thermal indices. This study recommends applying systematic and objective statistical methods like linear regression and discriminant analysis in order to successfully modify the entire index scale"

Methodological approach,"This study comprises three stages: first, a comprehensive literature review of articles which examine human thermal perception in the outdoor environment by field meteorological measurements and questionnaire surveys. Second, a comparison of data analysis methods and techniques for human thermal perception assessment. Third, a suggested framework and protocol for human thermal perception research"
Results,Following the application of the approach described in a systematic literature review identified 194 peer-reviewed articles which investigat
Discussions,"Numerous studies have tried to quantify human thermal perception in outdoor urban environments worldwide. In the absence of an agreed protocol for outdoor bio-meteorological research, scholars have used a variety of methods to define human thermal comfort range and l stress thresholds relying on protocols such as ASHRAE 55 and EN ISO 10551 that were originally developed for indoor ("
Conclusions,"A comprehensive literature review was carried out for the years 2001â€“2021. It identified 194 peer-reviewed studies which combined in-situ micrometeorological measurements versus subjective thermal perception applying different indices.
It was found that the number of case studies that have succeeded to determine thermal comfort range and complete full scale modification by the same method is too small for a meaningful comparison. 
This is as a result of the absence of an agreed protocol for outdoor human thermal assessment. Further research is therefore required in order to make a meaningful comparison of thermal adaptation to varied climatic zones and weather conditions."
